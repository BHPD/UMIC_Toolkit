# Stitching HAADF
1. Copy the exported HAADF files to an empty folder (e.g. 'Tiles', see above)
1. In FIJI: File -> New -> TrakEM2 (blank)
    a. Select folder (e.g. '{EM number}', see above)
2. Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: Import -> import sequence as grid...
    a. Select the first HAADF to be stitched.
    b. Input correct number of rows and columns & check ONLY 'montage with phase correlation' -> OK.
    c. Press OK (optional: adjust overlap if a different overlap is used).
5. (optional if stitching was unsatisfactory) Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: align -> montage all images in this layer.
    Note: this will use another approach towards aligning the images.
    a. Press OK 4 times.
    b. Check 'tiles are roughly in place' -> OK.
    c. If stitching still unsuccesful, adjust parameters in the windows at 4a.
    d. Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: Display -> Autoresize canvas/LayerSet.
        Note: minimizes black area (in x and y) around the stitched dataset.
6. Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: Project -> Save as...
    a. Save as .xml file (e.g. in '{EM number}' folder as {EM number}.xml, see above.).

# Exporting HAADF
7. Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: Export -> Make flat image...
    a. Check 'Best quality' -> OK.
8. In FIJI select the image and go to: File -> Save As -> Tiff... (shortcut: CTRL + S).
    a. Save as {element name}.tiff (e.g. in 'Exports' folder, see above).

# Exporting other elements
9. Overwrite the .tiff copies with the, to be stitched and exported, element tiffs.
    Note: replace all, make sure this is the tile folder for TrakEM2 (e.g. 'Tiles', see above)
10. Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: Project -> Flush image cache
11. Right-click TrakEM2 canvas: Project -> Regenerate all mipmaps
12. Repeat steps 8 and 9 to export this stitched image.
13. For other elements, repeat steps 10, 11, 12 and 13.
